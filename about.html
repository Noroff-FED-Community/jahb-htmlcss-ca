          Game Hub Corporation was founded in 2005 by a group of avid gamers who
          saw an opportunity to create a better online gaming retail experience.
          Frustrated with the limited selection and poor customer service offered
          by existing online retailers, the founders of Game Hub set out to create
          a platform that would offer a wider selection of games, better prices,
          and exceptional customer service.

          In the early days, Game Hub operated out of a small office in
          Kongsvinger, not far from Oslo, with just a handful of employees working
          to build the company's website and establish relationships with game
          developers and publishers. Despite the challenges of launching a new
          business in a competitive market, the team was passionate about their
          mission and worked tirelessly to build a platform that would meet the
          needs of gamers around the world.

          Over the years, Game Hub continued to grow and expand, adding new
          products, services, and features to its platform. In 2010, the company
          launched its mobile app, allowing customers to browse and purchase games
          on the go. In 2015, Game Hub introduced its pre-order program, giving
          customers the ability to reserve their copies of upcoming games before
          they were even released. Today, Game Hub is one of the most popular
          online gaming retailers in the world, with a vast selection of games and
          gaming accessories available for purchase. Despite its success, the
          company remains true to its founding principles, providing exceptional
          customer service and a user-friendly platform that makes it easy for
          gamers to find and purchase the games they love.
